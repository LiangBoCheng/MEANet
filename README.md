# MEANet
# Requirements
python 3.7 + pytorch 1.9.0
# Saliency maps
We provide saliency maps of our MEANet on ORSSD and EORSSD datasets in './MEANet_results.zip'  
We also provide saliency maps of our MEANet on [DUT-O](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HC0nLaURFVOvUPetNu5_hA?pwd=MEAN) (code:MEAN), [DUTS-TE](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1etx9GEXYGxzFfjhYan_OfA?pwd=MEAN) (code:MEAN), [HKU-IS](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iC3CWOlcOgJA1sgymwlF8w?pwd=MEAN) (code:MEAN), [ECSSD](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1J-2sWr7VQP3DFU89ZlMmWw?pwd=MEAN) (code:MEAN), [PASCALS](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aMqhG_KA8ic7vHGegnyKjA?pwd=MEAN) (code:MEAN)
# Training
Run train_MEANet.py.
# Pre-trained model and testing
Download the following pre-trained model and put them in ./models/MEANet/, then run test_MEANet.py.  
[MEANet_EORSSD](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uowO3bZHL45hZ875xhhTYA) (code:lbc0)  
[MEANet_ORSSD](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I14LsveMLB-F08XCAsZqEg) (code:lbc1)
# Evaluation Tool
You can use the [evaluation tool (MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.
